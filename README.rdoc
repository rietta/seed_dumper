= SeedDumper

Seed dumper is a simple plugin that adds a rake task named db:seed:dump.
Forked and simplified from seed_dump. If you require

It allows you to create a db/seeds.rb from your existing data in the database.
When there is no data in the database it will generate empty create statements.

It mainly exists for people who are too lazy writing create statements in db/seeds.rb themselves
and need something (+seed_dump+) to dump data from the table(s) into seeds.rb

== Example Usage

Dump all data directly to db/seeds.rb:

  rake db:seed:dump


Result:

  $ cat db/seeds.rb
  # Autogenerated by the db:seed:dump task
  # Do not hesitate to tweak this to your needs

  products = Product.create([
    { :category_id => 1, :description => "Long Sleeve Shirt", :name => "Long Sleeve Shirt" },
    { :category_id => 3, :description => "Plain White Tee Shirt", :name => "Plain T-Shirt" }
  ])

  users = User.create([
    { :id => 1, :password => "123456", :username => "test_1" },
    { :id => 2, :password => "234567", :username => "tes2" }
  ])


==

Dump all database tables directly to db/seeds/table_name.rb

  rake db:seed:legacy_dump

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
